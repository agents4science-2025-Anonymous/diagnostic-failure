# Diagnostic Failure Paradigm - Agents4Science 2025

## Quick Start
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/agents4science-2025-Anonymous/diagnostic-failure

# Run with Docker (recommended)
docker build -t diagnostic-failure .
docker run diagnostic-failure

# Or run locally
pip install -r requirements.txt
bash run.sh
```

## Agent Architecture
The Diagnostic & Evaluation Agent discovered that interpretable failures of simple models provide rigorous benchmarks for complex AI systems. A linear model's paradoxical failure (R²=-4.35×10⁴) coexisting with frequency-domain success (γ²=0.676) revealed rich diagnostic information.

## Key Contributions
- **Diagnostic Failure Protocol**: 3-step methodology for AI benchmarking
- **Multi-objective validation**: Time-domain AND frequency-domain requirements
- **Architectural prescription**: Failures guide system design

## Algorithm
```
Algorithm 1: Diagnostic Failure Protocol
Inputs: Complex system, Classical interpretable model
Steps: 
  1. Induce & Isolate Failure
  2. Quantify Multi-Domain Signature
  3. Establish Performance Envelope
Outputs: Multi-objective benchmark, Architectural hypothesis
```

## Reproducibility
All results can be reproduced with `bash run.sh`
